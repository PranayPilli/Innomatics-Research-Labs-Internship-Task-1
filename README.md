# Innomatics Research Labs – Internship Task 1

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Advanced Generative AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs.

The assignment focuses on building core Python logic through practical problems including:

1)User authentication check  
2)Pass/Fail result analysis  
3)Data cleaning and standardization  
4)Message length validation  
5)Error log detection  

The implementation uses fundamental Python concepts such as conditional statements, loops, lists, and string methods.

# Innomatics Research Labs – Internship Task 2

This repository contains my submission for Logic Building Task 2 of the Advanced Generative AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs.

The assignment focuses on strengthening Python fundamentals through practical problems including:

1) Unique words identification in a sentence  
2) Highest salary detection from employee data  
3) Finding maximum and minimum values  
4) Counting products above a price threshold  
5) Calculating attendance percentage  
6) Removing duplicate phone numbers  
7) Counting character frequency  
8) Converting list to tuple  
9) Checking key existence in a dictionary  
10) Calculating average marks  

The implementation uses core Python concepts such as lists, dictionaries, sets, loops, conditional statements, and basic mathematical operations.


All solutions are implemented using clean, structured, and well-commented Python code as per the internship guidelines.
