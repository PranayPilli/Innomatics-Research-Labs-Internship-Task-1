# Innomatics Research Labs – Internship Task 1

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Advanced Generative AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs.

The assignment focuses on building core Python logic through practical problems including:

1)User authentication check  
2)Pass/Fail result analysis  
3)Data cleaning and standardization  
4)Message length validation  
5)Error log detection  

The implementation uses fundamental Python concepts such as conditional statements, loops, lists, and string methods.

# Innomatics Research Labs – Internship Task 2

This repository contains my submission for **Logic Building Task – 2** as part of the Data Science Internship (February 2026) at Innomatics Research Labs.

## Task Overview

This task focuses on strengthening core Python fundamentals through practical logic-building problems.

The problems covered include:

- Finding unique words in a sentence
- Identifying the highest salary from employee data
- Finding maximum and minimum values in a list
- Counting products above a price threshold
- Calculating attendance percentage
- Removing duplicate phone numbers
- Counting character frequency in a string
- Converting list to tuple
- Checking key existence in a dictionary
- Calculating average marks

## Concepts Used

- Lists and Tuples  
- Dictionaries  
- Sets  
- Conditional Statements  
- Loops  
- String Methods  
- Basic Mathematical Operations  

All solutions are implemented using clean, structured, and well-commented Python code as per the internship guidelines.
