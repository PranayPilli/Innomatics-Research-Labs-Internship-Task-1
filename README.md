# Innomatics Research Labs – Internship Task 1

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Advanced Generative AI Internship at Innomatics Research Labs.

The assignment focuses on building core Python logic through practical problems including:

1)User authentication check  
2)Pass/Fail result analysis  
3)Data cleaning and standardization  
4)Message length validation  
5)Error log detection  

The implementation uses fundamental Python concepts such as conditional statements, loops, lists, and string methods.
